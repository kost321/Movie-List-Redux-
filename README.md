# MOVIE-LIST

This project was bootstrapped with React, using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template.

### In this project, I released a film search site where you can:
1) Find a movie by queries using filters.
2) Add a movie with its image and description.
3) Delete movie
4) Edit movie
5) By clicking on a movie, you can get detailed information about the movie.
6) Implemented pagination, which displays the number of all pages or found movies.
7) You can sort the movie by rating.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Movies API Server

1)I used [server](https://github.com/VarvaraZadnepriak/MoviesAPI.ReactJS#readme).

2)After installing the repository locally, run npm start on it.

### Usage

1)Run 'npm start' in folder MOVIELISTPROJECT

2)The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
